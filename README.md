We aim to use AI/ML solutions to ensure the Name of Candidate will not cause DEI problem.

We find that the NLTK and SapCy are the library that can accomplish our goal to exact name from resume.

if want to reuse the code, simply change the path of the document to the resume that you want to process and run the code.

[dei_implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11tZVlT4Qryq1xFoWgCdR6XaLMSRiCua-?usp=sharing):

After testing for the stabilities and other factor, we choose to use SapCy as our solution.

All you need to do is to chance the input path to your local/online storage file address, then after running the code, you will get the processed resume **without actual name and email address**.
